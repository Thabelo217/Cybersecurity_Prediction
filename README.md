 ## 🔐 Cybersecurity Predictions using Machine Learning

📖 Overview
This project explores how machine learning can be applied to cybersecurity — either for intrusion detection, job/salary prediction, or anomaly detection. The notebook demonstrates how data science techniques such as preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and interpretability (via SHAP) can be used to uncover insights in cybersecurity datasets.


🎯 Problem Statement
Traditional cybersecurity systems rely heavily on manual rules that struggle to detect emerging threats. This project develops a machine learning-based solution to **predict cybersecurity patterns** (e.g., anomalies, job salaries, or security events) from historical data, enabling smarter, data-driven security decisions.

## 🧠 Objectives
- Preprocess and analyze cybersecurity-related data.
- Build and compare multiple machine learning models (Random Forest, XGBoost, Isolation Forest, etc.).
- Evaluate model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Apply explainable AI techniques (SHAP) for model interpretation.
- Provide insights that can guide proactive cybersecurity strategies.
